      <h2>Muhammad Ali's Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War in 1967, based on his religious and moral objections, resulted in his boxing titles being stripped and a three-year suspension from the sport during the prime of his career. Undeterred, he stood by his principles and became an iconic symbol of opposition to the war.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Supreme Court overturned his conviction in 1971, Ali made a triumphant return to the boxing ring. He engaged in legendary bouts with Joe Frazier, George Foreman, and other top contenders, showcasing his unrivaled athleticism, agility, and tactical brilliance. Ali's strategy of "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee" became synonymous with his unique boxing style and contributed to his incredible success in the ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Muhammad Ali's impact extends far beyond his boxing career. His charisma, quick wit, and magnetic personality made him a global icon. He was not only a sports legend but also a tireless advocate for humanitarian causes. Ali worked passionately for civil rights, racial equality, and the promotion of peace and understanding among people of all backgrounds and beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali received numerous awards and accolades throughout his life, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. Even after his retirement from boxing, he remained an inspiration to millions around the world. Muhammad Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, leaving behind an enduring legacy as a sporting legend, cultural icon, and champion for social justice.
